### Architecture

The SAP Advanced Financial Closing SDK for CDS is build on the following architecture open source
building blocks as depicted in the following diagram:

![Architecture Concept](./docs/assets/architecture_concept_node.svg)

- **WebSocket Adapter for CDS** (https://github.com/cap-js-community/websocket)
  - Exposes a WebSocket protocol via WebSocket standard or Socket.IO for CDS services. Runs in context of the SAP
    Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) using @sap/cds (CDS Node.js).
- **Event Queue for CDS** (https://github.com/cap-js-community/event-queue)
  - The Event-Queue is a framework built on top of CAP Node.js, designed specifically for efficient and streamlined
    asynchronous event processing
- **Feature Toggle Library for CDS** (https://github.com/cap-js-community/feature-toggle-library)
  - SAP BTP feature toggle library enables Node.js applications using the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model to
    maintain live-updatable feature toggles via Redis

Using the SAP Advanced Financial Closing SDK a 3rd-party scheduling provider can be built for SAP Advanced Financial Closing.
The architectural design of the SAP Advanced Financial Closing (AFC) SDK for implementing a Scheduling Provider is based
on the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) and SAP Build Code. It leverages the [@cap-js-community](https://github.com/cap-js-community)
open-source components to enable scheduling services in AFC.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the SAP Advanced Financial Closing SDK for CDS (Node.js):

![Architecture Design](./docs/assets/architecture_design_node.svg)

**Key components and processing flow**:

- **SAP Advanced Financial Closing (AFC):**
  - Sends scheduling requests via AFC Scheduling Service Provider Interface using REST
    API ([OpenAPI](https://hub.sap.com/api/SSPIV1))
- **Scheduling Provider Service:**
  - Handles incoming scheduling requests
  - Creates scheduling jobs synchronously and places asynchronous requests into the Event Queue
- **Scheduling Processing Service:**
  - Processes scheduled jobs asynchronously
  - Retrieves job requests from the Event Queue and executes them.
- **Scheduling WebSocket Service:**
  - Listens for status updates of scheduled jobs
  - Notifies the Monitoring Scheduling Job UI via WebSockets when job statuses change
- **Scheduling Monitoring Service:**
  - Monitoring Scheduling Job UI (SAP Fiori Elements V4 / SAP UI5 application)
  - Reads scheduling job details from the database
  - Supports monitoring via OData V4 API
  - Displays scheduling job statuses and updates in real-time via WebSockets
- **Event Queue & Feature Toggles:**
  - Event Queue (using CDS Outbox) facilitates asynchronous job execution
  - Feature Toggles allow influence Job and Event Queue processing dynamically
- **Database & Redis Caching:**
  - Stores job scheduling data in the database
  - Redis is used for information distribution (e.g. Event Queue, WebSockets, Feature Toggles)

### Implement

The SDK provides a set of services to implement the job processing service and the scheduling provider service.

#### Job Processing

The job processing service is responsible for processing the jobs.

#### Mock Processing

The library includes a mocked processing for jump-start development, which is disabled by default via option.
`cds.requires.sap-afc-sdk.mockProcessing: false`

Setting option `cds.requires.sap-afc-sdk.mockProcessing: true` a basic mocked job processing completes
jobs based on a random time value between `0-10` seconds:

```json
{
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
      "sap-afc-sdk": {
        "mockProcessing": {
          "min": 0,
          "max": 10,
          "default": "completed"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The project can be adjusted to use basic mock processing automatically via command:

- Terminal: `afc add -b mock`

A more advanced mocked Job processing can be configured by setting the
following [CDS env](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-env) options (as described in [options](#options)):

```json
{
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
      "sap-afc-sdk": {
        "mockProcessing": {
          "min": 0,
          "max": 10,
          "default": "completed",
          "status": {
            "completed": 0.5,
            "completedWithWarning": 0.2,
            "completedWithError": 0.2,
            "failed": 0.1
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This default advanced mocked Job processing can be also configured by using CDS profile `mock` via `--profile mock` or
`CDS_ENV=mock`.

The project can be adjusted to use advanced mock processing (without additional `mock` profile) automatically via command:

- Terminal: `afc add -a mock`

Mock configuration can be adjusted in `package.json` afterward.

To disable mock processing remove CDS env `cds.requires.sap-afc-sdk.mockProcessing`, e.g. via command:

- Terminal: `afc add -x mock`

The default implementation of the job processing is already provided by the SDK. Focus can be put on
custom processing logic, and the processing status update handling.

#### Custom Processing

To implement a custom job processing extend the job processing service definition as follows:

**CDS file:** `/srv/scheduling-processing-service.cds`

```cds
using SchedulingProcessingService from '@cap-js-community/sap-afc-sdk';

annotate SchedulingProcessingService with @impl: '/srv/scheduling-processing-service.js';
```

**Implementation file:** `/srv/scheduling-processing-service.js`

```js
const { SchedulingProcessingService, JobStatus } = require("@cap-js-community/sap-afc-sdk");

class CustomSchedulingProcessingService extends SchedulingProcessingService {
  async init() {
    const { processJob, updateJob, cancelJob, syncJob } = this.operations;

    this.on(processJob, async (req, next) => {
      // Your logic goes here
      await next();
    });

    this.on(updateJob, async (req, next) => {
      // Your logic goes here
      await next();
    });

    this.on(cancelJob, async (req, next) => {
      // Your logic goes here
      await next();
    });

    this.on(syncJob, async (req, next) => {
      // Your logic goes here
      await next();
    });

    super.init();
  }
}

module.exports = CustomSchedulingProcessingService;
```

A stub implementation for custom scheduling processing service can be generated via command:

- Terminal: `afc add stub`

As part of the custom scheduling process service implementation, the following operations can be implemented:

- `on(processJob)`:
  - A new job instance was created and needs to be processed
  - The job is due (start date time is reached), and the job is ready for processing
  - Implement your custom logic, how the job should be processed
  - Job ID is accessible via `req.data.ID` and job data can be accessed via `req.job`
  - Test run can be identified via flag `req.data.testRun` (if job definition supports test mode)
  - Call `await next()` to perform default implementation (set status to `running`)
  - Job update can be performed via `this.processJobUpdate()` providing the new status and job results
    - e.g. `await this.processJobUpdate(req, JobStatus.completed, results)`
  - Result `data` object shall contain stream objects to prevent data materialization
  - Throwing exceptions will automatically trigger the retry process in Event Queue
  - Disable mocked job processing via `cds.requires.sap-afc-sdk.mockProcessing: false` (default).
- `on(updateJob)`:
  - A job status update is requested and the job results are stored
  - Implement your custom logic, how the job status should be updated
  - Job data can be retrieved via `req.job`
  - Job status transition is validated via `async checkStatusTransition(req, statusBefore, statusAfter)`
    - Valid status transitions are defined in `this.statusTransitions`
    - Check function and status transitions can be customized
  - Job results are checked and processed via `async checkJobResults(req, results)`
    - Valid results are valid according to job results signature constraints (see below)
    - Returns the processed job results to be inserted
  - Call `await next()` to perform default implementation (update status to requested status)
- `on(cancelJob)`:
  - A job cancellation is requested
  - Implement your custom logic, how the job should be canceled
  - Job data can be retrieved via `req.job`
  - Call `await next()` to perform default implementation (update status to `canceled`)

The job results signature is defined as follows:

```cds
type ResultTypeCode   : String enum {
  link;
  data;
  message;
};

type MessageSeverityCode : String enum {
  success;
  info;
  warning;
  error;
};

type JobResult {
  name     : String(255) not null;
  type     : ResultTypeCode not null;
  link     : String(5000);
  mimeType : String(255);
  filename : String(5000);
  data     : LargeBinary;
  messages : many JobResultMessage;
};

type JobResultMessage {
  code      : String(255) not null;
  text      : String(5000);
  severity  : MessageSeverityCode not null;
  createdAt : Timestamp;
  texts     : many JobResultMessageText;
};

type JobResultMessageText {
  locale : Locale not null;
  text   : String(5000);
};
```

Multiple job results can be passed for job update.
The following constraints apply for each job result type:

- `link`:
  - Properties `name` and `link` need to be provided
  - Other properties are not allowed
- `data`:
  - Properties `name`, `mimeType`, `filename` and `data` need to be provided
  - Data needs to be provided as base64 encoded string
  - Other properties are not allowed
- `message`:
  - Properties `name` and `messages` need to be provided
  - Messages need to be provided as array of job result messages
  - Other properties are not allowed

Job processing is performed as part of the Event Queue processing. The Event Queue is a framework built on top of CAP
Node.js, designed specifically for efficient and streamlined asynchronous event processing. In case of errors, the Event Queue
provides resilient processing (circuit breaker, retry, load-balancing, etc.).

In addition, to overwriting the default implementation via an `on` handler, also additional `before` and `after` handlers can be registered.

#### Job Provider

A job provider service is already provided per default by the SDK, implementing
the [SAP Advanced Financial Closing Scheduling Service Provider Interface](https://hub.sap.com/api/SSPIV1).
Therefore, focus can be put on additional custom provider logic (e.g. streaming of data from a remote location).

The **SAP Advanced Financial Closing Scheduling Service Provider Interface** is published on SAP Business Accelerator Hub
under package **SAP Advanced Financial Closing** at https://api.sap.com/api/SSPIV1.

To implement a custom job provider extend the job provider service definition as follows:

**CDS file:** `/srv/scheduling-provider-service.cds`

```cds
using SchedulingProviderService from '@cap-js-community/sap-afc-sdk';

annotate SchedulingProviderService with @impl: '/srv/scheduling-provider-service.js';
```

**Implementation file:** `/srv/scheduling-provider-service.js`

```js
const { SchedulingProviderService } = require("@cap-js-community/sap-afc-sdk");

class CustomSchedulingProviderService extends SchedulingProviderService {
  async init() {
    const { Job, JobResult } = this.entities;

    this.on("CREATE", Job, async (req, next) => {
      // Your logic goes here
      await next();
    });

    this.on(Job.actions.cancel, Job, async (req, next) => {
      // Your logic goes here
      await next();
    });

    this.on(JobResult.actions.data, JobResult, async (req, next) => {
      // Your logic goes here
      await next();
    });

    super.init();
  }
}

module.exports = CustomSchedulingProviderService;
```

A stub implementation for custom scheduling provider service can be generated via command:

- Terminal: `afc add stub`

As part of the custom scheduling provider service implementation, the following operations can be implemented:

- `on("CREATE", Job)`:
  - Validates and creates a new job instance
  - Call `await next()` to perform default implementation
  - `after`: Calls scheduling processing service function `processJob`
- `on(Job.actions.cancel, Job)`:
  - Cancels a job
  - Call `await next()` to perform default implementation
  - `after`: Calls scheduling processing service function `cancelJob`
- `on(JobResult.actions.data, JobResult)`:
  - Call `await next()` to perform default implementation
  - Streams data of a job result (type `data`) from DB to response

In addition, to overwriting the default implementation via an `on`-handler, also additional `before` and `after` handlers can be registered.

#### Periodic Job Sync

A periodic scheduling job synchronization event named `SchedulingProcessingService.syncJob` is running per default every **1 minute**
in the Event Queue, to perform job synchronization from an external source. The default implementation is a no-op.

The event `syncJob` is registered automatically with cron interval `*/1 * * * *` in the Event Queue configuration.
To change the cron interval, the Event Queue configuration can be adjusted in the CDS env:

**CDS Env:**

```json
{
  "cds": {
    "requires": {
      "SchedulingProcessingService": {
        "outbox": {
          "events": {
            "syncJob": {
              "cron": "*/2 * * * *"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `cron` interval option defines the periodicity of the scheduling job synchronization.

**CDS file:** `/srv/scheduling-processing-service.cds`

```cds
using SchedulingProcessingService from '@cap-js-community/sap-afc-sdk';

annotate SchedulingProcessingService with @impl: '/srv/scheduling-processing-service.js';
```

**Implementation file:** `/srv/scheduling-processing-service.js`

```js
const { SchedulingProcessingService } = require("@cap-js-community/sap-afc-sdk");

class CustomSchedulingProcessingService extends SchedulingProcessingService {
  async init() {
    const { syncJob } = this.operations;

    this.on(syncJob, async (req, next) => {
      // Your logic goes here
      await next();
    });

    super.init();
  }
}

module.exports = CustomSchedulingProcessingService;
```

A stub implementation for periodic job sync can be generated via command:

- Terminal: `afc add stub`

Details on how to implement periodic event via Event Queue can be found in
[Event-Queue documentation on Periodic Events](https://cap-js-community.github.io/event-queue/configure-event/#periodic-events).

### API

The SDK based application expose the scheduling provider API. The out-of-the-box open service broker implementation
can be used to manage service keys and access tokens to the API.
After [Deployment](#deployment) the [Service Broker](#service-broker) can be registered in Cloud Foundry.

After adding the broker to project via `afc add broker`, the default configuration is located at:

- `srv/broker.json`: Open service broker configuration
- `srv/catalog.json`: Open service broker catalog configuration

In addition, the broker configuration can be provided via options
as part of CDS environment in `cds.requires.sap-afc-sdk.broker` section.

More details on how to use the service broker can be found in the [Service Broker](#service-broker) section.

### Redis

The application can be scaled by adding a Redis cache to distribute workload across application instances.
Add Redis to the project (already part of [Adding SDK](#adding-sdk) for CAP Node.js):

- Terminal: `cds add redis`

Redis is used by `@cap-js-community/event-queue`, `@cap-js-community/websocket` and `@cap-js-community/feature-toggle-library`
modules to process events, distribute websocket messages and store and distribute feature toggles values.

### Feature Toggles

The Feature Toggle Library is used to control the execution of the Event Queue.
It exposes endpoints to manage feature toggles:

- `GET /rest/feature/state()`: Read current feature toggle state
- `POST /rest/feature/redisUpdate`: Update feature toggle state

See `.http` files in [/http/toggles](./http/toggles) to call feature toggle endpoints.
An internal OAuth token needs to be fetched via [/http/auth/uaa.internal.cloud.http](./http/auth/uaa.internal.cloud.http)
providing credentials from XSUAA instance or via calling:

- Terminal: `afc api key -i`

## CAP Java

The SAP Advanced Financial Closing SDK for CDS provides a plugin
for [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) for Java](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/java)
to extend and integrate with SAP Advanced Financial Closing (AFC). Specifically, it provides an out-of-the-box
implementation of the [SAP Advanced Financial Closing Scheduling Service Provider Interface](https://hub.sap.com/api/SSPIV1)
to expose a Scheduling Provider service to manage Job definitions and Jobs. Furthermore, it brings the following out-of-the-box virtues:

- **API**: Exposes a RESTful API implementing the AFC Scheduling Provider Interface to manage Job definitions and Jobs
- **Outbox**: Provides an Outbox to process and synchronize Jobs (periodically) asynchronously and resiliently (circuit breaker, retry,
  load-balancing, etc.)
- **Websocket**: Provides websocket connection support to monitor Job processing live
- **UI**: Provides a UI5 application to monitor and cancel Jobs
- **Broker**: Implements a service broker to manage service key management to API

### Architecture

The SAP Advanced Financial Closing SDK for CDS is build on the following architecture open source
building blocks as depicted in the following diagram:

![Architecture Concept](./docs/assets/architecture_concept_java.svg)

Using the SAP Advanced Financial Closing SDK a 3rd-party scheduling provider can be built for SAP Advanced Financial Closing.
The architectural design of the SAP Advanced Financial Closing (AFC) SDK for implementing a Scheduling Provider is based
on the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) and SAP Build Code.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the SAP Advanced Financial Closing SDK for CDS (Java):

![Architecture Design](./docs/assets/architecture_design_java.svg)

**Key components and processing flow**:

- **SAP Advanced Financial Closing (AFC):**
  - Sends scheduling requests via AFC Scheduling Service Provider Interface using REST
    API ([OpenAPI](https://hub.sap.com/api/SSPIV1))
- **Scheduling Provider Service:**
  - Handles incoming scheduling requests
  - Creates scheduling jobs synchronously and places asynchronous requests into the Event Queue
- **Scheduling Processing Service:**
  - Processes scheduled jobs asynchronously
  - Retrieves job requests from the Event Queue and executes them.
- **Scheduling WebSocket Service:**
  - Listens for status updates of scheduled jobs
  - Notifies the Monitoring Scheduling Job UI via WebSockets when job statuses change
- **Scheduling Monitoring Service:**
  - Monitoring Scheduling Job UI (SAP Fiori Elements V4 / SAP UI5 application)
  - Reads scheduling job details from the database
  - Supports monitoring via OData V4 API
  - Displays scheduling job statuses and updates in real-time via WebSockets
- **Transactional Outbox:**
  - CDS Transactional Outbox facilitates asynchronous job execution
- **Database:**
  - Stores job scheduling data in the database

### Implement

The SDK provides a set of services to implement the job processing service and the scheduling provider service.

#### Job Processing

The job processing service is responsible for processing the jobs.

#### Mock Processing

The library includes a mocked processing for jump-start development, which is disabled by default
(no `sap-afc-sdk.mock-processing` config in `application.yml`).

Setting option `sap-afc-sdk.mockProcessing` a basic mocked job processing completes
jobs based on a random time value between `0-10` seconds:

```yaml
sap-afc-sdk:
  mock-processing:
    min: 0
    max: 10
    default: completed
```

The project can be adjusted to use basic mock processing automatically via command:

- Terminal: `afc add -b mock`

A more advanced mocked Job processing can be configured by setting the
following [CDS env](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/cds-env) options (as described in [options](#options)):

```yaml
sap-afc-sdk:
  mock-processing:
    min: 0
    max: 10
    default: completed
    status:
      completed: 0.5
      completedWithWarning: 0.2
      completedWithError: 0.2
      failed: 0.1
```

The project can be adjusted to use advanced mock processing automatically via command:

- Terminal: `afc add -a mock`

Mock configuration can be adjusted in `application.yaml` afterward.

To disable mock processing remove config `sap-afc-sdk.mockProcessing`, e.g. via command:

- Terminal: `afc add -x mock`

The default implementation of the job processing is already provided by the SDK. Focus can be put on
custom processing logic, and the processing status update handling.

#### Custom Processing

To implement a custom job processing extend the job processing service definition as follows:

**Implementation file:** `srv/src/main/java/customer/scheduling/CustomSchedulingProcessingHandler.java`

```java
package customer.scheduling;

import com.github.cap.js.community.sapafcsdk.model.schedulingprocessingservice.*;
import com.github.cap.js.community.sapafcsdk.scheduling.base.SchedulingProcessingBase;
import com.sap.cds.services.handler.annotations.HandlerOrder;
import com.sap.cds.services.handler.annotations.On;
import com.sap.cds.services.handler.annotations.ServiceName;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@ServiceName(SchedulingProcessingService_.CDS_NAME)
public class CustomSchedulingProcessingHandler extends SchedulingProcessingBase {

  @On(event = ProcessJobContext.CDS_NAME)
  @HandlerOrder(HandlerOrder.EARLY)
  public void processJob(ProcessJobContext context) {
    // Your logic goes here
    context.proceed();
  }

  @On(event = UpdateJobContext.CDS_NAME)
  @HandlerOrder(HandlerOrder.EARLY)
  public void updateJob(UpdateJobContext context) {
    // Your logic goes here
    context.proceed();
  }

  @On(event = CancelJobContext.CDS_NAME)
  @HandlerOrder(HandlerOrder.EARLY)
  public void cancelJob(CancelJobContext context) {
    // Your logic goes here
    context.proceed();
  }

  @On(event = SyncJobContext.CDS_NAME)
  @HandlerOrder(HandlerOrder.EARLY)
  public void syncJob(SyncJobContext context) {
    // Your logic goes here
    context.proceed();
  }
}

```

A stub implementation for custom scheduling processing service can be generated via command:

- Terminal: `afc add stub`

As part of the custom scheduling process service implementation, the following operations can be implemented:

- `processJob`:
  - A new job instance was created and needs to be processed
  - The job is due (start date time is reached), and the job is ready for processing
  - Implement your custom logic, how the job should be processed
  - Job ID is accessible via `context.get("ID")`
  - Test run can be identified via flag `context.get("testRun")` (if job definition supports test mode)
  - Call `context.proceed()` to perform default implementation (set status to `running`)
  - Job update can be performed via `this.processJobUpdate()` providing the new status and job results
    - e.g. `this.processJobUpdate(context, JobStatusCode.completed, results)`
  - Throwing exceptions will automatically trigger the retry process in outbox
  - Disable mocked job processing by deleting `sap-afc-sdk.mockProcessing` (default).
- `updateJob`:
  - A job status update is requested and the job results are stored
  - Implement your custom logic, how the job status should be updated
  - Job ID is accessible via `context.get("ID")`
  - Job status transition is validated via `this.checkStatusTransition(context, statusBefore, statusAfter)`
    - Valid status transitions are defined in `this.statusTransitions`
    - Check function and status transitions can be customized
  - Job results are checked and processed via `checkJobResults(context, results)`
    - Valid results are valid according to job results signature constraints (see below)
    - Returns the processed job results to be inserted
  - Call `context.proceed()` to perform default implementation (update status to requested status)
- `cancelJob`:
  - A job cancellation is requested
  - Implement your custom logic, how the job should be canceled
  - Job ID is accessible via `context.get("ID")`
  - Call `context.proceed()` to perform default implementation (update status to `canceled`)

The job results signature is defined as follows:

```cds
type ResultTypeCode   : String enum {
  link;
  data;
  message;
};

type MessageSeverityCode : String enum {
  success;
  info;
  warning;
  error;
};

type JobResult {
  name     : String(255) not null;
  type     : ResultTypeCode not null;
  link     : String(5000);
  mimeType : String(255);
  filename : String(5000);
  data     : LargeBinary;
  messages : many JobResultMessage;
};

type JobResultMessage {
  code      : String(255) not null;
  text      : String(5000);
  severity  : MessageSeverityCode not null;
  createdAt : Timestamp;
  texts     : many JobResultMessageText;
};

type JobResultMessageText {
  locale : Locale not null;
  text   : String(5000);
};
```

Multiple job results can be passed for job update.
The following constraints apply for each job result type:

- `link`:
  - Properties `name` and `link` need to be provided
  - Other properties are not allowed
- `data`:
  - Properties `name`, `mimeType`, `filename` and `data` need to be provided
  - Data needs to be provided as base64 encoded string
  - Other properties are not allowed
- `message`:
  - Properties `name` and `messages` need to be provided
  - Messages need to be provided as array of job result messages
  - Other properties are not allowed

Job processing is performed as part of the Event Queue processing. The Event Queue is a framework built on top of CAP
Node.js, designed specifically for efficient and streamlined asynchronous event processing. In case of errors, the Event Queue
provides resilient processing (circuit breaker, retry, load-balancing, etc.).

In addition, to overwriting the default implementation via an `on` handler, also additional `before` and `after` handlers can be registered.

#### Job Provider

A job provider service is already provided per default by the SDK, implementing
the [SAP Advanced Financial Closing Scheduling Service Provider Interface](https://hub.sap.com/api/SSPIV1).
Therefore, focus can be put on additional custom provider logic (e.g. streaming of data from a remote location).

The **SAP Advanced Financial Closing Scheduling Service Provider Interface** is published on SAP Business Accelerator Hub
under package **SAP Advanced Financial Closing** at https://api.sap.com/api/SSPIV1.

To implement a custom job provider extend the job provider service definition as follows:

**Implementation file:** `srv/src/main/java/customer/scheduling/CustomSchedulingProviderHandler.java`

```java
package customer.scheduling;

import com.github.cap.js.community.sapafcsdk.model.schedulingproviderservice.*;
import com.github.cap.js.community.sapafcsdk.scheduling.base.SchedulingProviderBase;
import com.sap.cds.services.cds.CdsCreateEventContext;
import com.sap.cds.services.cds.CqnService;
import com.sap.cds.services.handler.annotations.HandlerOrder;
import com.sap.cds.services.handler.annotations.On;
import com.sap.cds.services.handler.annotations.ServiceName;
import java.util.List;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@ServiceName(SchedulingProviderService_.CDS_NAME)
public class CustomSchedulingProviderHandler extends SchedulingProviderBase {

  @On(event = CqnService.EVENT_CREATE, entity = Job_.CDS_NAME)
  @HandlerOrder(HandlerOrder.EARLY)
  public void createJob(CdsCreateEventContext context, List<Job> jobs) {
    // Your logic goes here
    context.proceed();
  }

  @On(event = JobCancelContext.CDS_NAME, entity = Job_.CDS_NAME)
  @HandlerOrder(HandlerOrder.EARLY)
  public void cancelJob(JobCancelContext context) {
    // Your logic goes here
    context.proceed();
  }

  @On(event = JobResultDataContext.CDS_NAME, entity = JobResult_.CDS_NAME)
  @HandlerOrder(HandlerOrder.EARLY)
  public void downloadData(JobResultDataContext context) {
    // Your logic goes here
    context.proceed();
  }
}

```

A stub implementation for custom scheduling provider service can be generated via command:

- Terminal: `afc add stub`

As part of the custom scheduling provider service implementation, the following operations can be implemented:

- `createJob`:
  - Validates and creates a new job instance
  - Call `context.proceed()` to perform default implementation
  - `after`: Calls scheduling processing service function `processJob`
- `cancelJob`:
  - Cancels a job
  - Call `context.proceed()` to perform default implementation
  - `after`: Calls scheduling processing service function `cancelJob`
- `downloadData`:
  - Call `context.proceed()` to perform default implementation
  - Streams data of a job result (type `data`) from DB to response

In addition, to overwriting the default implementation via an `on`-handler, also additional `before` and `after` handlers can be registered.

#### Periodic Job Sync

A periodic scheduling job synchronization event named `SchedulingProcessingService.syncJob` is running per default every **1 minute**
in Spring scheduling tasks, to perform job synchronization from an external source. The default implementation is a no-op.

The event `syncJob` is registered automatically with interval Spring scheduling configuration.
To change the interval, the `application.yaml` configuration can be adjusted in the Spring environment:

**Application file:**

```yaml
sap-afc-sdk:
  syncJob:
    cron: 0 */2 * * * *
```

**Implementation file:** `srv/src/main/java/customer/scheduling/CustomSchedulingProcessingHandler.java`

```java
package customer.scheduling;

import com.github.cap.js.community.sapafcsdk.model.schedulingprocessingservice.*;
import com.github.cap.js.community.sapafcsdk.scheduling.base.SchedulingProcessingBase;
import com.sap.cds.services.handler.annotations.HandlerOrder;
import com.sap.cds.services.handler.annotations.On;
import com.sap.cds.services.handler.annotations.ServiceName;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
@ServiceName(SchedulingProcessingService_.CDS_NAME)
public class CustomSchedulingProcessingHandler extends SchedulingProcessingBase {

  @On(event = SyncJobContext.CDS_NAME)
  @HandlerOrder(HandlerOrder.EARLY)
  public void syncJob(SyncJobContext context) {
    // Your logic goes here
    context.proceed();
  }
}

```

A stub implementation for periodic job sync can be generated via command:

- Terminal: `afc add stub`

### API

The SDK based application expose the scheduling provider API. The out-of-the-box open service broker implementation
can be used to manage service keys and access tokens to the API.
After [Deployment](#deployment) the [Service Broker](#service-broker) can be registered in Cloud Foundry.

After adding the broker to project via `afc add broker`, the default configuration is located in `application.yaml` at:

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    openservicebroker:
      catalog:
        services: ...
```

For details see [Spring Cloud Open Service Broker](https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-open-service-broker) documentation.

More details on how to use the service broker can be found in the [Service Broker](#service-broker) section.

## Deployment
